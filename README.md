## Experimentation repo for the "Tuning computer vision models with task rewards" paper

This repository includes some of my code experimentations with the ideas presented in the paper [Tuning computer vision models with task rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08242).

Currently WIP - 
* Need to debug detection recall fine-tuning to match similar increase trends as in the paper (despite using different base model).
* Need to implement the logic for more tasks.
